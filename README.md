# coding-assessment-marmeto

I have developed a project with the objective of fetching product information for a specific category (selected by the user in the tab) from the external API to display on the web page. I have implemented all the requirements that were given in the assessments. When the user clicks the category in the tab, certain categories's data are displayed as cards on the page. The data retrieved from the API is correctly displayed in the space specified by the design. The user deselects the category to choose another category.
